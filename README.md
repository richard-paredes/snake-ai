# Snake AI

Welcome to the Snake AI project! This repository houses a modern implementation of the classic Snake game, built with Python and managed using Poetry for handling dependencies and virtual environments. The unique aspect of this project is its adaptability for training neural networks to play the Snake game, providing an exciting intersection of game development and machine learning.

## About

The Snake game is a timeless classic where the player navigates a snake to consume items on the screen. As the snake eats, it grows in length, and the challenge is to avoid crashing into the walls or the snake's own growing body. This implementation not only serves as an engaging game but also as a platform for developing and testing neural network algorithms in a dynamic environment.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Core game logic, UI, and neural network interface are decoupled for ease of development and portability across platforms.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Ready-to-use interface for training machine learning models to play the game.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed for easy adaptation to desktop, mobile, and web platforms.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project, you will need [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up and run the game:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/richard-paredes/snake-ai.git
   cd snake-ai
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Active the Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```
4. **Run the Game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
